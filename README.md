# CompaJ Project
This is the home of the CompaJ Project - programming and numeric computing platform for math modelling.

## Status
Project is under active development. CompaJ supports only basic functions and models, which are not intended to use in real projects.

## Structure
CompaJ has modular structure and consists of:

- [CompaJ Core](https://github.com/CrissNamon/compaj/tree/main/core)
    - Core is a library with basic content for CompaJ. It contains simple functions and models.
- [CompaJ Applied](https://github.com/CrissNamon/compaj/tree/main/applied)
    - Applied module contains ready to use models.
- [CompaJ Lang](https://github.com/CrissNamon/compaj/tree/main/lang)
    - CompaJ Lang is an object oriented and optionally typed programming language based on Groovy with useful extensions to reduce redundant symbols and simplify calculations.
- [CompaJ REPL](https://github.com/CrissNamon/compaj/tree/main/repl)
    - CompaJ REPL is a console application which provides all functionality of CompaJ Lang.
- [CompaJ](https://github.com/CrissNamon/compaj/tree/main/gui)
    - CompaJ is a standalone application with GUI and many useful tools for CompaJ REPL.
